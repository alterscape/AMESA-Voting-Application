AMESA Voting Application

This simple Rails 3 application is intended for electronic voting in a graduate student association's election. The app is posted here both to facilitate review of the code by members (to look for bugs/vulnerabilites) and on the off chance it's useful to somebody else who needs to hold a kinda-but-not-really secure election.

The app uses Devise/Warden to verify users' identities.  Registrations are disabled in Devise. I'll be checking in code soon that allows the administrator to add email addresses from a membership list, assign random passwords, and email notification to members.  

Members' votes are NOT recorded, but the fact that they've voted is. Assuming I've implemented the details correctly, this means each member can only vote once. Since only the totals are recorded, this means that a member CANNOT modify their vote after submitting. Sorry, but that's the way it works. I'm open to suggestions for improvements in both security and privacy here.
